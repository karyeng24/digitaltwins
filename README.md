This development-based project proposes an innovative approach to data center security planning by implementing Digital Twin technology to automate and optimize network topology generation. Traditional network modeling tools, such as GNS3, rely on manual drag-and-drop configurations, which are inefficient and time-consuming for large-scale deployments. To address this limitation, this project introduces an AI-driven network diagram generator that leverages the OpenAI API to interpret natural language commands and dynamically construct network diagrams. Users can intuitively add, modify, or remove network components through text-based inputs, significantly accelerating the design process while reducing human error. The system features an export function that allows users to save generated network diagrams in .png format for documentation, analysis, and compliance purposes. Additionally, future enhancements will integrate a honeypot within the digital twin environment to simulate cyber-attacks, assess vulnerabilities, and strengthen defensive strategies in a risk-free setting. The project follows a structured development methodology, including requirements analysis, prototype design, API integration, and iterative testing. Expected outcomes include a user-friendly, scalable tool that enhances network planning efficiency while adhering to cybersecurity best practices. By bridging the gap between AI automation and network security, this solution aims to provide IT professionals with a more efficient and intelligent approach to data center infrastructure modelling.
